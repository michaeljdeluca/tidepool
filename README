TIDEPOOL is an open source Twitter visualization tool. Basically, in this, its nascent version, it follows a certain #hashtag in real time and renders visually the frequency of words used in tweets featuring that hashtag.

Tidepool is written in Processing.js. Processing.js is a set of JQuery JavaScript libraries which allow the Java-based Processing visual programming language to be written in JavaScript and thus run in any HTML5 compatible browser.
